# Fabric Medallion Pipeline (Demo)

This repository contains a **demo data pipeline** built on **Microsoft Fabric**, following the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold).  
It ingests structured (CSV), semi-structured (GeoJSON), and tabular data into **OneLake**, transforms them in a **Lakehouse**, and publishes curated analytics into a **Warehouse** for **Power BI**.
